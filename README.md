Redundancy  1.9.15 branch
=================================
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/squarerootfury/redundancy.svg?branch=Lenticularis)](https://travis-ci.org/squarerootfury/redundancy)

> Please note: This branch is _only_ for developing purposes. This version is bleeding edge, instable, uncomplete and does not have all functions

Redundancy is an lightweight cloud computing system. The program is so lightweight that you can run it on microservers like the Raspberry Pi without having too much load.
Redundancy does not require full server access. It can be installed on every server running a webserver using PHP. The configuration is very easy through a central configuration file. At the moment it does not have a "bling bling" configuration wizard. The stable branch will probably get an installer and an installation wizard, too. The biggest difference between Redundancy and other programs for this purpose is that you get a very lightweight user
experience. There are no unnecessary features you probably never use. Redundancy focuses on the core of the task to create an easy cloud, for example to use at home.
